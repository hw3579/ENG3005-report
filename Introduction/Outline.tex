In this laboratory experiment, the focus is on determining the lift force acting on an aerofoil using the Air Flow bench in a vertical wind tunnel. By examining the pressure distribution across the aerofoil's surface at varying angles of attack, the experiment aims to relate this pressure to the overall lift produced by the aerofoil.
