In this laboratory experiment, the focus is on determining the lift force acting on an airfoil using the Air Flow bench in a vertical wind tunnel. By examining the pressure distribution across the airfoil's surface at varying angles of attack, the experiment helps to relate these pressure to the overall lift produced by the airfoil.
